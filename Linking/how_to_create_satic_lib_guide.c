Here is a step-by-step guide on how to create a basic static library in C using Visual Studio Code and link it with a C file to create an executable file:

Open Visual Studio Code and create a new folder for your project. You can do this by selecting File > New Folder or by using the shortcut Ctrl + Shift + N.

Create a new file in the folder and name it mylibrary.c. This file will contain the functions that you want to include in your static library.

Write your library code in mylibrary.c. For example, you can write a simple function that adds two numbers and returns the result:

int add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}


Next, you need to compile the code into an object file. To do this, 
open the terminal in Visual Studio Code and navigate to your project folder. Then, run the following command:

gcc -c mylibrary.c

This will create a new file named mylibrary.o in your project folder.

Now you need to create the static library file. To do this, run the following command in the terminal:

ar rcs libmylibrary.a mylibrary.o

This will create a new file named libmylibrary.a in your project folder. This is your static library file.

Now you can create a new C file and link it with the library to create an executable file. 
For example, create a new file named main.c and write the following code:

#include <stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b);

int main()
{
    int result = add(2, 3);
    printf("The result is %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}

To compile the main.c file and link it with the library, 
run the following command in the terminal:


gcc -o myprogram main.c -L. -l libmylibrary

This will create a new executable file named myprogram in your project folder. The -L. option tells the compiler to look for the library file in the current directory, and the -lmylibrary option tells it to link with the libmylibrary.a file.

Finally, you can run the myprogram executable by running the following command in the terminal:

./myprogram

This will run the program and output the result of the add function.

And that's it! You have now created a basic static library in C using 
Visual Studio Code and linked it with a C file to create an executable file.
